## Project Description
This project consists of three communicating apps, A1, A2 and A3, described below. The apps are supposed
to work together in order to allow a user to shop for smart phones.
1. Application A1 contains two activities and a broadcast receiver. The main activity contains a welcome
message and a button. When the button is pressed, the activity checks whether app A1 has obtained
dangerous permission edu.uic.cs478.s19.kaboom. (This permission is defined in app A3 below.) If A1
does not have the permission, it requests it of the user. If the user grants the permission, processing continues by creating and registering its broadcast receiver programmatically. Subsequently, A1 launches
the main activity in app A2 and enters the stopped state.
The broadcast receiver catches broadcast intents sent by A3 and launches the second activity in order to
display the image of the smart phone.
The second activity is intended to display the web page of smart phones as requested by A3. The broadcast intent will contain an extra specifying the smart phone whose page must be displayed. The activity
should be destroyed when the user starts a new activitiy on top of it. (It is automatically destroyed,
when the user presses the “back” button.)
2. Application A2 consists of a single activity and a broadcast receiver. The activity is started by A1;
however, this activity requires that the A1 activity have permission edu.uic.cs478.s19.kaboom. If A1
does not have the permission, A2’s main activity is not started. Otherwise, the main activity of A2
displays a welcome message and a button. When the button is pressed, the activity checks whether A2
was granted permission edu.uic.cs478.s19.kaboom. If A2 does not have the permission, it requests it
in a way similar to A1. If the permission is granted, A2 registers its receiver and then starts the main
activity in application A3. If the permission is denied, A2 displays a toast message and terminates itself.
3. Application A3 contains a single activity that consists of two fragments. In addition A3 defines permission edu.uic.cs478.s19.kaboom. This application starts when its main activity receives the intent sent by
A2, if A2 has permission edu.uic.cs478.s19.kaboom. In this case, A3’s main activity is displayed with
its first fragment.
App A3 maintains an action bar. The action bar shows the name of the application and an icon associated with the application (your choice). The action bar has an options menu that displays just two
menu options: (1) launch applications A1 and A2 and (2) exit A3. When the first item is selected, A3
broadcast a single, ordered intent to start A1 and A2. Assuming that A1 and A2 have the permission,
A2 will first display its toast message, then A1 will display the web page of the currently selected smart
phone. If no smart phone is selected yet, no intent is sent and a toast message is displayed instead.
The main activity in A3 contains two fragments. The first fragment displays a list of smart phone names.
(Each list item consists of a single string.) The device user may select any point from the list; when this
happens, the selected item is highlighted. The second fragment shows an image of the selected item.
When the device is in portrait mode, the two fragments are displayed on different screens. First, the
device will show only the first fragment. When the user selects an item, the the first fragment disappears
and the second fragment is shown. Pressing the “back” soft button on the device, will return the device
to the original configuration (first fragment only), thereby allowing the user to select a different smart
phone. When the device is in landscape mode, application A3 initially shows only the first fragment
across the entire width of the screen. As soon as a user selects an item, the first fragment is “shrunk”
to about 1/3 of the screen’s width. This fragment will appear in the left-hand side of the screen, with
the second fragment taking up the remaining 2/3 of the display on the right. Again, pressing the “back”
button will return the application to its initial configuration. The action bar should be displayed at all
times regardless of whether the device is in portrait or landscape mode.
Finally, the state of application A3 should be retained across device rotations, e.g., when the device is
switched from landscape to portrait configuration and vice versa. This means that the selected list item
(in the first fragment) and the page displayed in the second fragment will be kept during configuration
changes.
As for the order of execution of A1 and A2’s receivers, you should configure these apps in such a way that
a receiver in A2 is always executed before the receiver in A1, after A3 sends a broadcast.
